# Vector IO

A collection of utility functions and scripts to import and export vector datasets between various vector databases.

The representation that we export to is:
1. parquet file for the vectors (to be changed to Parquet)
2. SQLite for metadata

Feel free to send a PR to add an import/export implementation for your favorite vector DB.

## Export

    Export data from Pinecone, Weaviate and Qdrant to sqlite database and parquet file.

    Usage:
        python export.py <vector_database> [options]

    Arguments:
        vector_database (str): Choose the vectors database to export data from.
            Possible values: "pinecone", "weaviate", "qdrant".

    Options:
        Pinecone:
            -e, --environment (str): Environment of Pinecone instance.
            -i, --index (str): Name of index to export.

        Weaviate:
            -u, --url (str): Location of Weaviate instance.
            -c, --class_name (str): Name of class to export.
            -i, --include_crossrefs (bool): Include cross references, set Y or N.

        Qdrant:
            -u, --url (str): Location of Qdrant instance.
            -c, --collection (str): Name of collection to export.

    Examples:
        Export data from Pinecone:
        python export.py pinecone -e my_env -i my_index

        Export data from Weaviate:
        python export.py weaviate -u http://localhost:8080 -c my_class -i Y

        Export data from Qdrant:
        python export.py qdrant -u http://localhost:6333 -c my_collection
