# Vector IO

A collection of utility functions and scripts to import and export vector datasets between various vector databases.

The representation that we export to is:
1. CSV file for the vectors (to be changed to parquet)
2. SQLite for metadata

Feel free to send a PR to add an import/export implementation for your favorite vector DB.
